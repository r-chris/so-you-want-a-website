# So, you want a website?

Well, you've come to the right place. If you want to build your own website, but don't know where to start, there are a few things you should know.

## Domain Name

This is the web-address where your website can be found (e.g. r-chris.github.io)

## Website Hosting

This is where your website will be stored. You need space on a computer that is connected to the internet (also known as a server). You place your webpages onto this computer (just as you would with your regular documents) and then allow people from the internet to access these files.

### Self-Hosting from your home

Potentially, this could be your own computer in your home. If you have a somewhat *decent* internet connection (read: decent **upload** speed) and you only expect limited traffic to your webpage, you could host your own website on your own computer. In fact, Mac OS X ships with a build-in option to share a specific website folder with a single click.

As you can expect, this computer now has to be turned on 24h/day, because you expect your website to be available online 24h/day: it can never go to sleep! If you have a laptop, this probably isn't the solution you are looking for. The internet connection (your router) also has to stay online 24h/day. If anyone unplugs the router or you loose electricity (etc) your website will be offline. Maybe that's ok, but it's not something you expect to happen today. Lastly, your computer also has to be properly secured from potential attacks, because as soon as you open access to your computer, it becomes a target. I am not trying to scare you - you just need to know.

### Third-party Hosting

The obvious alternative is to host your website somewhere else. Imagine you have a Dropbox (or Google Drive, etc) folder that contains the files for your websites. In this case Dropbox uploads and stores these files somewhere for you (on their servers) and you can access them any time you want, right?

Ok, so Dropbox and Google Drive are free up to a specific amount and you would now think - great - let's just store the files there. Unfortunately, these services are not designed to host your websites. That is, because hosting a website is more than just sharing a folder with a few files and it's simply not their business model.

**Alright, so where then?**

## Github

Well, github for example allows you to create basic webpages for your projects or you as a user. There are even a number of default layouts you can choose from and you can assign an address in this form: r-chris.github.io

You can read more about this here: https://pages.github.com/

## Google Sites

You can also use a google service to do something similar, but it feels a bit outdated to me.

## Profile Pages

If all that you are after is a profile if yourself, consider one of the social sites such as LinkedIn or ResearchGate. They generally allow you to create a fairly short url to share with anyone and those are trusted places that people feel comfortable with.
